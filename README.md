This repository contains implementation code for two fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms: SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) and Value Iteration. These algorithms are pivotal for solving decision-making problems under uncertainty, and this codebase is designed to help you understand and apply these techniques in various scenarios.

## Description

This project provides practical implementations of the SARSA and Value Iteration algorithms. Here's a brief overview of each algorithm included in this repository:

- **SARSA**: An on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that updates the action-value function based on the action taken and the reward received, following the current policy. It is particularly useful for learning policies that dictate an agent's way to behave in a stochastic environment.

- **Value Iteration**: An off-policy algorithm that iteratively updates the values assigned to each state to find the optimal policy. This method is robust and converges to the optimal policy and value function after a sufficient number of iterations.

Both algorithms are implemented in Python using libraries such as NumPy for handling numerical operations efficiently.
